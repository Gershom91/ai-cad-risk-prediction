# 🌟 AI CAD Risk Prediction App  
### *Machine Learning Web App for Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Risk Assessment*

---

## 🚀 Overview
This project is a fully deployed **AI-powered Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Risk Prediction System**.  
It uses a trained **Random Forest classifier** to estimate the probability of CAD based on common diagnostic measurements.

It demonstrates a complete **end-to-end ML pipeline**:
- Data preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training & evaluation  
- Model export (`.pkl`)  
- Deployment using **Streamlit Cloud**

This app is designed for:
- Educational & medical research purposes  
- Machine learning portfolio showcase  
- Demonstrating ML deployment skills
